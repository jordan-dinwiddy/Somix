Minix for FUSE

Project started 13th March 2010

Author: Jordan Dinwiddy


Description
===========
This project investigates a number of techniques for improving filesystem performance
on Solid State Drives (SSDs). As part of the work carried out, a new simple filesystem
called Somix was developed - providing the framework for which optimisations could be
implemented, tested and analysed. The results of this project show that two out of the three
optimisations implemented have the ability to improve performance on an underlying SSD.
Unfortunately however, the scenarios for which these optimisations are most beneficial 
seem reasonably rare.
