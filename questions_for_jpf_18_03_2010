1) 	so part of dissertation is walk through of what I did. Shall I talk about how
	implemented minix then went back and had to change things to implement a
	buffer cache?
2)	So next up is modifying the buffer cache to not just write dirty blocks
	when it finds them but to instead push them to a secondary buffer and
	when that buffer hits 128K then block remapping code executes and all
	data gets flushed at once.
3)	Then it is possible this will cause write amplification so we try a FAT
	table.
